Final Project 


A shiny application that allows for visual exploration of a data set, giving the user the ability to manipulate and control of plot features in a way that allows for powerful, complex stories to be uncovered through visual display of the data.

The interactivity adds significant value beyond what could be accomplished in a static visualization.

The documentation and R code must is thorough, clean and efficient. The user interface needs is user friendly and agile.
